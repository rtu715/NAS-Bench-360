# DenseNAS

The code of the CVPR2020 paper [Densely Connected Search Space for More Flexible Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.09607).

Neural architecture search (NAS) has dramatically advanced the development of neural network design. We revisit the search space design in most previous NAS methods and find the number of blocks and the widths of blocks are set manually. However, block counts and block widths determine the network scale (depth and width) and make a great influence on both the accuracy and the model cost (FLOPs/latency).
