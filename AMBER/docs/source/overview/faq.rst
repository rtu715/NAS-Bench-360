PENDING: A growing list for Frequently-Asked-Questions.

1. Do I need a GPU to run AMBER?
    A: You don't need a GPU to run AMBER; however, having a GPU could significantly speed up AMBER architecture search
    and training process. For some simpler tasks (e.g. number of training samples < 100k), it is possible to run AMBER
    on CPUs.

2. I still have questions, what should I do?
    A: Please open an issue at AMBER GitHub - it is possible the same issue has been opened previously; otherwise, the
    developers will work on the issue as soon as possible.
